Just a start to get things going, planning on doing a lot more objects (obviously) like larger objects like the bowl, 
different ramps/loops/pipes? and moving objects plus other objects we talked about (mask and background objects to be done later).

The DoubleSided.shader can be applied so the outter sides of bowls are not seethrough BUT sometimes that's a good thing 
because when you're inside the bowl it means your view isn't obstructed.

Flipper, whacker and spinning things would be moving if used.

Any tips/ideas would be great.

Hey man :D I just woke up and looked at the models. They look pretty good! The next step is texturing but we can sort that out later (I don't mind doing the texturing).
It would be easier to talk on skype, so I'll be online for most of today if you want to chat. I noticed a few things with you models that might need tweaking, but nothing
major. Probably the next models could be a half pipe bend connector? or perhaps a full pipe. Just ideas. We got plenty of time and we're off to a great start. Thanks
for your hard work :)

Ok, I have training now until 9 tonight and then get back onto it. I'll send a message on skype if you're still around then, 
otherwise I'm free all tomorrow.
